## Human curators

Curators are people that help us [discover](#user-content-discover-system) new content published on lbry.
Everyone can become a curator by creating a [channel](https://lbry.tech/spec#channels) and following this guidelines:

- Discover and recommend awesome channels with original content.

- Report [unlicensed content](https://lbry.com/faq/dmca) or [metadata abuse](https://lbry.com/dmca)

- Verify metadata of new discovered content and notify creators if further changes are required to improve discoverability.

| :warning: | Only use a single channel for curation. It is recommended to include the `curator` tag in the channel metadata. ( This will be required in the future )
|---|:---|

## Discover system

Hound.fm provides a community-driven discovery system powered by [curators](...).

A "discover" is a simple action triggered by the curator on a new content, the first curator to trigger this action is assigned as the discoverer.

| :warning: | This actions should be triggered `only` on content that the curator wants to recommend to the community, in order to preserve a more organic discoverability.
|---|:---|

In other words a "discover" is basically a recommendation done by the curator and broadcasted to the community:

> Curator: Hey, I found this awesome track (stream claim) by `@channel`, check it out. 
>
> Hound.fm: Curator has discovered a new track by @channel, check it out.
> 
> Community: Ok nice, I'll listen later...

#### Curator actions:

An "action" is just an special [transaction](https://lbry.com/faq/transaction-types), once is verified it will take a few minutes to appear as a new discover.

| Name | Description
|---|:---|
| Repost | Share a link to another LBRY claim 

Only repost transactions are detected, but in the future we will include other types like supports, tips, reaction, ...etc.


Once the discover is verified it will be aggregated and broadcasted to the community.

| :warning: | It is important that the curator verifies the credibility of the content origins and the metadata provided: If not enough metadata is provided the content won't be aggregated and the discover is ignored, this is also true if the aggregation system detects metadata abuse.
|---|:---|


## Content creators

| :warning: | Work in progress, we need more feedback from other creators.
