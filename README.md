## Human curators

Curators are people that help us [discover](...) new content published on lbry.
Everyone can become a curator by creating a [channel](https://lbry.tech/spec#channels) and following this guidelines:

- [Discover](...) awesome channels and original content.

- Report [unlicensed content](https://lbry.com/faq/dmca) or [metadata abuse](https://lbry.com/dmca)

- Verify metadata of new discovered content and notify creators if further changes are required to improve discoverability.

| :warning: | Only use a single channel for curation. It is recommended to include the `curator` tag in the channel metadata. ( This will be required in the future )
|---|:---|

## Discover system

Hound.fm provides a community-driven discovery system powered by [curators](...).

A "discover" is a simple action triggered by the curator on a new content, the first curator to trigger this action is assigned as the discoverer.

| :warning: | This actions should be triggered `only` on content that the curator wants to recommend to the community, in order to preserve a more organic discoverability.
|---|:---|

In other words a "discover" is basically a recommendation done by the curator and broadcasted to the community:

> Curator: Hey, I found this awesome track (stream claim) by `@channel`, check it out. 
>
> Hound.fm: Curator has discovered a new track by @channel, check it out.
> 
> Community: Ok nice, I'll listen later...

#### Curator actions:

An "action" is just an special [transaction](https://lbry.com/faq/transaction-types), once is aproved it will take a few minutes to appear as a new discover.

| Name | Description
|---|:---|
| Repost | Share a link to another LBRY claim 

Once the discover is verified it will be aggregated and broadcasted to the community.

| :warning: | It is important that the curator verifies the credibility of the content origins and the metadata provided: If not enough metadata is provided the content won't be aggregated and the discover is ignored, this is also true it the aggregation system detects metadata abuse.
