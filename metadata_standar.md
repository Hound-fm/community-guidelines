### Metadata

> Metadata is structured information about a stream or channel separate from the content itself (e.g. the title, language, media type, etc.). It is stored in the blockchain as the value property of a claim.

### Open Standar

> Using standardised metadata descriptions makes datasets:

    - More discoverable
    - Easily syndicated
    - Transferable
    - Easily combined with other datasets
    
> Ultimately makes it easier for datasets to be used in real-world situations to add value.
