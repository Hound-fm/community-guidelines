## Metadata Standar

> Using standardised metadata descriptions makes datasets more discoverable, more easily syndicated, more transferable, and ultimately makes it easier for datasets to be used in real-world situations to add value.
>
> Consistency between datasets means datasets are:

    - More discoverable
    - Easily syndicated
    - Transferable
    - Easily combined with other datasets
